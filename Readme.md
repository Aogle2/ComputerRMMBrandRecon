Hello, this little project is a demostration on how to present data from a Database.
Just a small idea on how presenting data can be done and should give an idea the diversity of Operating Systems, Vendors and Manufacturers.

## Getting Started On Windows Based Systems

What you will need for this application to work on your system:

1. Download and Install Git from this link: https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.46.0.windows.1/Git-2.46.0-64-bit.exe

2. Download and install Python 3 from this link: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.5/python-3.12.5-amd64.exe


Once steps 1 and 2 are completed in any order:
1. Click on Start
2. Type "CMD"
3. If you are not at ``` C:\Users\Your_Profile_Name> ```
	Type ``` cd ~ ``` to get to that location.

Then Type/copy and paste

4. ``` git glone https://github.com/Aogle2/Computer_RMM_Brand_Recon.git ``` 

Wait for the clone to finish

5. ``` cd Computer_RMM_Brand_Recon ```

6. ``` python -m venv venv ```

7. ``` source venv\scripts\activate ```

8. ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

Wait for pip to install all the requirements.

9. ```python main\userinteraction.py```

10. Enjoy the little demo and click around? It's fairly easy to break but shows a bit of what is possible and what could be inspired by it.

When done type in ``` deactivate ``` to leave the virtual enviroment.
